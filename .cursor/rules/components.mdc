# Component Design

## Reusability

- **Check `src/components/ui/` first.** Before building UI, see what primitives already exist. Compose from existing components when possible.

- **Extract when you see duplication.** If similar UI appears twice, that's a signal. Three times is a mandate.

- **Keep components focused.** A component that needs many props to configure its behavior is often multiple components in disguise.

## Component Boundaries

- **Separate concerns:** Data fetching, state management, and presentation should live in different places.

- **Props down, events up.** Components receive data via props and communicate changes via callbacks. Avoid reaching up or sideways.

- **Co-locate related code.** Styles, types, and helpers that only serve one component should live near that component.

## State

- **Lift state only as high as necessary.** Not everything belongs in global state. Start local, lift when needed.

- **Derive don't duplicate.** If a value can be computed from other state, compute it. Don't store it separately.
