# Architecture & Clean Code

## Before Writing Code

1. **Look first.** Before creating anything new, search the codebase for similar patterns, components, or utilities. Reuse or extend what exists.

2. **Understand the context.** Know what depends on this code and what it depends on. Changes have ripple effects.

3. **Question the abstraction level.** Is this the right place for this logic? Too high = overly generic. Too low = duplicated elsewhere.

## When Writing Code

4. **One job per module.** Each file, component, or function should have a single clear responsibility. If you're struggling to name it, it's probably doing too much.

5. **Make dependencies explicit.** No hidden coupling. If something depends on something else, that relationship should be visible and intentional.

6. **Prefer composition over complexity.** Small, focused pieces that combine well beat large, configurable pieces that handle everything.

7. **Name things for what they do, not how they work.** Implementation details change. Purpose doesn't.

## When Reviewing Your Work

8. **Find the leverage point.** What's the one thing in this change that matters most? Focus your attention there.

9. **Know what you're trading off.** Every design decision trades something. Be able to articulate what you're optimizing for and what you're sacrificing.

10. **Don't abstract speculatively.** Create abstractions when you see real duplication or clear reuse—not because something "might" be reused later.
