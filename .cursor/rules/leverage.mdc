# The 80/20 Principle

Focus on the 20% of effort that delivers 80% of the value.

## In Practice

- **Solve the hard problem first.** Don't polish details until the core is right.

- **Good enough is often enough.** Perfect code that ships late loses to good code that ships now.

- **Optimize the bottleneck.** Find what actually limits the system before optimizing anything else.

- **Simple beats clever.** Clever solutions cost more to understand, maintain, and debug than they save.

- **Cut scope, not quality.** When under pressure, do fewer things well rather than more things poorly.

## Questions to Ask

- What's the smallest change that would make the biggest difference?
- If I could only ship one part of this, which part matters most?
- Am I polishing something that doesn't need to be polished yet?
- Is this complexity earning its keep?
